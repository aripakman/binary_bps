# Binary BPS Sampler 

C++ implementation and MATLAB wrapper for the sampling algorithm introduced in 
["Binary Bouncy Particle Sampler"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00922.pdf), 
presented at the NIPS 2017 Workshop Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference. 

This implementation targets the binary Markov Random Fields used in the paper.

See comments in the file binary_demo.m for instructions.
